##Â Personnal Projects

Here are some of my personnal projects (made during my spare time).

All of them were made before I joined [ENSICAEN](https://www.ensicaen.fr/en/), so they don't represent all of my coding skills (especially in software architecture).

It is made with javascript and a bit of HTML.

### SyncGaming

It is an app for windows to sync save of games between several computers.
It is initialy made to be on a USB key, and it recognizes the computer in which it is plugged.

It is made in C++ with Qt.


### Discord Bot

It is a discord bot using discord.js. It also includes a web server and use discord oauth to login.

It is made with Discord.js and node.js.
