## Personal Projects

Here are some of my personal projects (made during my spare time).

All of them were made before I joined [ENSICAEN](https://www.ensicaen.fr/en/), so they don't represent all of my coding skills (especially in software architecture).

### stream@crikxi

It is a small web extension that sends requests to API of different streaming websites to alert when a live starts.

It is made with javascript and a bit of HTML.

### SyncGaming

It is an app for windows to sync save of games between several computers.
It is initially made to be on a USB key, and it recognizes the computer in which it is plugged.

It is made in C++ with Qt.


### Discord Bot

It is a discord bot using discord.js. It also includes a web server and uses discord oauth to log in.

It is made with Discord.js and node.js.

This project is probably deprecated because was written for an old version of discord.js.


## School Projects

These projects are some of the projects that I made during courses at [ENSICAEN](https://www.ensicaen.fr/en/).

### Epidemic Project

It is a simplified simulator of an epidemic made in a team of 4. 

One particularity of this project is the requirement to make different processes that would communicate with Pipe. In one of the processes, we should make several threads that would represent each person.

This project is made in C and the interface with GTK.

### RSSDisplay

RSS Display is an Android app made in Java, that display news feed from [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/) RSS.

The App uses a database to support offline use.


### Project Takuzu

The project is a video game made in C++ with Qt based on the game [Takuzu](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuzu).
